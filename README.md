This is a Selenium with C# Automation framework just in case I need to use one quick and I don't want to be setting up all from scratch.

## Technologies 👾

- ReqnRoll
- NUnit
- Allure Reports

## Installing this framework 💾
- Clone the project
- For this we will install Visual Studio 2022
- This framework is currently configured for MS Edge Browser only, but it uses WebDriverManager, so there  is no need to install download the driver.
- For ehnanced visualization and support of the feature files and step install the  _ReqnRoll for Visual Studio 2022_ extension.

## Running Tests 🏃
- TBD

## Github Actions ✔️
- TBD

## Troubleshooting 🔧
- If you see this message on Visual Studio `Test assembly not found. Please build the project to enable the Reqnroll Visual Studio Extension features.`. Rebuild the project and execute the tests. 
- If you add some steps for a feature file and ReqnRoll doesn't see them, just run the test and ReqnRoll will "update" itself and see the new steps.
